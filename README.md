## Configuring

**Storage methods** available are
- `file` (flat-file as JSON in the plugin folder)
- `mysql` (MySQL/MariaDB, configure the connection below), or
- `memory` (**not persistent** - will not save anything)

```yaml
storage-method: "file"
```

------

**Database connection** - configure your MySQL/MariaDB connection
if you use `mysql` as your storage method.
Otherwise these settings can be ignored.

```yaml
mysql-host: localhost
mysql-port: 3306
mysql-user: user
mysql-pass: pass
mysql-db: database
mysql-table: aquamarine_tickets
```

------

**Max tickets per radius** - this setting will limit the ability to create tickets 
close to each other (inside a radius). For example, with the settings below,
only 3 tickets can be opened simultaneously within a 5 block radius.

```yaml
enable-max-per-radius: true
check-radius: 5.0
max-per-radius: 3
```

------

**Max tickets per player** - this setting will limit the player's ability
to create tickets while old ones have not been resolved.


```yaml
enable-max-per-player: true
max-per-player: 3
```

------

**Message prefix** - used in the beginning of every system message sent by this plugin


```yaml
message-prefix: "&8[&bAquamarine&8] &7"
```

------

**Date format** - used when displaying dates and times
in the GUI and the chat view of tickets.
Uses [SimpleDateFormat](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html).

```yaml
date-format: "dd.MM.yyyy kk:mm:ss"   # (SimpleDateFormat)
```

------

**Join announcement** - when a player with admin/moderator permissions joins,
they will be notified about unresolved tickets.
Set the delay of the announcement in seconds.

```yaml
enable-join-announce: true
join-announce-delay-seconds: 5
```

------

**Discord webhook** - enable this and add a webhook URL to receive
announcements about new tickets to your Discord server.

```yaml
enable-webhook: false
webhook-url: https://example.com/
```
